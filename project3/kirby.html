    <h1>KIRBY</h1>
    <p> Kirby's species (individual members are called Kirbys) are small, round creatures with a pair of arms and feet-members of this species also appear to have blush on the sides of their faces. The only known members of the species are Kirby himself, Shadow Kirby, Keeby, and the other clones of Kirby. Meta Knight (and Dark Meta Knight as an extension), Galacta Knight, and Morpho Knight may also be Kirbys, and although there has been some, albeit not definitive, evidence that has accumulated since their debut, this has not been proven.</p>
