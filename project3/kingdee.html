    <h1>KING DEEDEE</h1>
    <p> 
        He is the greedy self-proclaimed king of Dream Land, which is located on the quaint Planet Popstar. Due to an ambiguous description of the geography of Popstar, it is never made entirely clear how much of the planet King Dedede assumes leadership of, though he seems to have castles and fortresses all across the planet. Even so, he seems to perform no administrative functions, and for the most part, the planet seems to ignore any edicts that are issued by him.</article>

    <h1>ABILITIES</h1>
    <p>
        His Dash Attack, Inhale and Super Dedede Jump (and possibly his Side Smash to some extent) are inspired by his attacks in Kirby's Dream Land.        <br>     <br> 
        By themselves, they do not give any Copy Abilities if inhaled unless an item carried by one bears an ability.       
<br>
He is able to jump in mid-air up to four times using his puff-up and fly ability (like Kirby).

<br><br>
He is classed as a heavyweight along with other Nintendo villains such as Bowser. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he even possesses the fastest falling speed and the lowest horizontal air speed, which gives him hampered mobility compared to the rest of the cast as well as making him more susceptible to combos done on fast-fallers but giving him strong vertical survivability
