    <h1>META KNIGHT</h1>
    <p> 
        Meta Knight is a major character in the Kirby  series, appearing in most of the  games, the manga, as well as the anime. The intrigue and popularity surrounding Meta Knight within the Kirby fandom largely lies in his enigmatic and solitary yet caring nature and his mysterious yet striking likeness to Kirby himself. Meta Knight is also the leader of an army of soldiers known as the Meta-Knights, and captains a large airship called Battleship Halberd, which may accompany him into the heat of battle.     </p>

    <h1>ABILITIES</h1>
    <p>
        Meta Knight can use his wings to perform up to five midair jumps.
         <br> 
         <br>      
        Flurry Attack (Neutral Attack): Shares similarities with Meta Multithrust. Starting in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Meta Knight ends this move with an uppercutting back-flip slash, somewhat like Meta Upper (although said move precedes Meta Multithrust in Kirby Super Star Ultra).
        <br>
        <br>
        Side Tilt Attack: This attack appears to be the inspiration for Meta Triple Slash in future Kirby games.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dash Attack: Resembles the Slide attack.
        Neutral Air Attack: Effectively the Knight Spin.
