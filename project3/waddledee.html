    <h1>WADDLE DEE</h1>
    <p> 
        Waddle Dees are a species native to the Planet Popstar. As some of the most common inhabitants of Dream Land they appear as both enemies and friendly NPCs. Many, but not all, Waddle Dees loyally serve King Dedede, the self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land, and he often involves them in his schemes. As an enemy, they are both the most basic and most common regular enemy, and a staple of the Kirby series, with Waddle Dee or some variant thereof appearing in every game since the first ever Kirby title, Kirby's Dream Land.     </p>

        By themselves, they do not give any Copy Abilities if inhaled unless an item carried by one bears an ability.
